In this folder, this and that is always the same. Why not in this one? (extensions, use, methods, )

List checks for data consistancy : 
+ php_functions list (is is all the other *.ini ? Same for interface, constant, trait, etc.)
+ aliases extensions?
+ Reference in function call ?

Finish overloaded for property/methods

testBySecond : testMethods are not used (neither setUp nor tearDown)

directInjection : Ignore 'secure' functions such as htmlentities, intval, isset

List tainted variables ($x = $_POST..) (the variables that may be reached in with tainted values).

die or throw ? May be die is useless and should be down by throwning all the time and adding an exception handler to stop the script.

Make various stats (deep level, switch w/o default, single or double quotes, etc...). This will help running (or not) some analyzers. 

Check the league of extraordinary packages

Enhanced Punit (for unit tests)

FuelPHP : 
Views are included; most properties are dynamical (defined in an array), framework is left out (many missing functions)

Test are TRUE (except for empty()). Otherwise, it just gets confusing. (An exception would be using ! empty(), as testing for false here is generally more intuitive.)

Add in the http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards

Spot similar arrays (with the same values) and mention them.

separate Project name from its folder

Remove S_ARRAY indexing (keepIndexed should be good)

Warning
Internally, PHP strings are byte arrays. As a result, accessing or modifying a string using array brackets is not multi-byte safe, and should only be done with strings that are in a single-byte encoding such as ISO-8859-1.

What size of code do I need to turn it into a functioncall ? 

Mark functions as idempotent (f(f(n)) == f(n))

Suggest constant by locating identical strings/numbers in special places ( case, comparisons...) Is it faster? Can it be made faster by using constants?

Separate 'files' with the official test and a script for short-tags, and the other compilation files.

        foreach($this->project_config as &$value) {
            if (is_array($value) && empty($value[0])) {
                unset($value[0]);
            }

(Translation, Explanation... Github document!)

Report a count : total count and count by analyzer (in a database for later merge?)

Make a script to check for tabs, end of file, end of line, UTF8 compatibility, spaces at the end of the line

Should have a parenthesis for readability

Spot alias to classes
    return \Hoa\Core\Consistency::from($namespace);

Spot classes of empty methods (surely something weird)

echo 'foo: ' . $x+1 . ' bar'; (ordre de priorité voir aussi */% and suggest adding () )

Also, usage of global and attempts à detecting global and their usage count (variables only once used will be removed)

unserialize is unsecure

Propriété/methods/constants filles utilisées par les parents.

Propriété dont la visibilité pourrait être durcie

Property overloading only works in object context. These magic methods will not be triggered in static context. Therefore these methods should not be declared static. As of PHP 5.3.0, a warning is issued if one of the magic overloading methods is declared static.

Note:
The return value of __set() is ignored because of the way PHP processes the assignment operator. Similarly, __get() is never called when chaining assignments together like this:
 $a = $obj->b = 8; 
 
Add a script to remove an update an analyzer cleanly

Glob : 
Note: This function isn't available on some systems (e.g. old Sun OS).
Note: The GLOB_BRACE flag is not available on some non GNU systems, like Solaris.

Spot common arrays / string / values that are identical accross the files : they should be constanted.

Check if a functioncall returns the compatible type for a nested functioncall

More Report.php to ../

Spot structures that will change in PHP 7 (see nick)

$host = strlen($host) > 0 ? $host : htmlentities($host);

// spot getId() as double call on same value (needs to know if method is determinist)
    $x = $v[0]->getId();
    $V[$x] =  $v[0]->getProperties();
    
    if (isset($V[$x]['root'])) {
        $root = $v[0]->getId();
    }

For backward compatibility reasons, array_key_exists() will also return TRUE if key is a property defined within an object given as array. This behaviour should not be relied upon, and care should be taken to ensure that array is an array.
To check whether a property exists in an object, use property_exists().

UselessOverridingMethodSniff.php (test on parent but on any grand-parents too :)

Function whose result must be captured (assignation or expression)

Spot using the persistent connexions (still possible?)

Should use transport rather than specific extension (bzip2, zip, zlib...).
Spot transport, protocols, etc. used in the code 

Warning
If your application does not catch the exception thrown from the PDO constructor, the default action taken by the zend engine is to terminate the script and display a back trace. This back trace will likely reveal the full database connection details, including the username and password. It is your responsibility to catch this exception, either explicitly (via a catch statement) or implicitly via set_exception_handler().

Use Object notation if possible (xmlwriter_open_memory => XMLWriter::open_memory)

Spot deep string expressions (BAD BAD BAD )

call_user_func with function that has references in the args

Duplicate calls : check that the whole call is used, not just the beginning of a fluent call.
// also avoir variables local to a loop

Always test index in arrays BEFORE (if (!isset($array['index'])) ) and not ($array['index'] == null)

Spot property that are accessed via an accessor but is internal to the object : suggest speed up by going to the property.

Extract analyzer from Gremlin Query Builder, so as to be able to measure size of the query, and collect dependencies automatically.

Spot the slowest analyzer automatically

There are some tokens which still have quite a lot of links to check when we near the end of the tokenizer call : check the cleaning

setlocale is bad on windows (see doc) Warning
The locale information is maintained per process, not per thread. If you are running PHP on a multithreaded server API like IIS or Apache on Windows, you may experience sudden changes in locale settings while a script is running, though the script itself never called setlocale(). This happens due to other scripts running in different threads of the same process at the same time, changing the process-wide locale using setlocale().

spot situations where code may be mistaken with the IDE ($x = 'a '.' b'; (=> 'a  b' and not "a '.' b")

The optional third argument is set to 1 if the lock would block (EWOULDBLOCK errno condition). (not supported on Windows)
