name = "Malformed Octal";
description = "Those numbers starts with a 0, so they are using the PHP octal convention. Therefore, one can't use 8 or 9 figures in those numbers, as they don't belong to the octal base. The resulting number will be truncated at the first erroneous figure. For example, 090 is actually 0, and 02689 is actually 22. 

PHP 7 emit an error when it finds an invalid octal number. 

Also, note that too large octal will be turned into a real number and undergo a reduction in precision.
typically 21 figures, indeed PHP_INT_MAX converted in octal. 

This analyzer also emits warning when octal numbers start with a large number of 0, like 000007.
