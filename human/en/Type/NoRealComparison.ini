name = "No Real Comparison";
description = "Avoid comparing decimal numbers with ==, ===, !==, != : those numbers have an error margin which is random, and makes it very difficult to match even if the compared value is a literal. 

Use formulas like 'abs($value - 1.2) < 0.0001' to approximate values with a given precision. ";
