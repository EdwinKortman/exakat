name = "Silently Cast Integer";
description = "Those are integer literals that are cast to a float when running PHP. They are simply too big for the current PHP version, and PHP resort to make them a float, which has a much larger capacity but a lower precision.

Compare your literals to PHP_MAX_INT (typically 9223372036854775807) and PHP_MIN_INT (typically -9223372036854775808).
This applies to binary (0b10101...), octals (0123123...) and hexadecimals (0xfffff...) too.
