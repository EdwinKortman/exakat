description = "This is a list of string using single quotes and Nowdoc syntax : as such, they are treated as literals, and they won't be scanned to interpolate variables.

However, there are some potential variables in those strings, making it possible for an error : the variable was forgotten and will be published as such. It is worth checking the content and make sure those strings are not variables.";
