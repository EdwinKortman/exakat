name = "Isset With Constant";
description = "Until PHP 7, it was possible to use arrays as constants, but it was not possible to test them with isset.

<?php
const X = [1,2,3];

if (isset(X[4])) {}
?>

This would yield an error : 

Fatal error: Cannot use isset() on the result of an expression (you can use \"null !== expression\" instead) in test.php on line 7

This is a backward incompatibility.
