name = "Not Substr One";
description = "There are two ways to access a byte in a string : substr($string, $pos, 1) or $v[$pos];

The second one is more readable. It may be up to four times faster, though it is a micro-optimization. 
It is recommended to use it. 

Beware that substr and $v[$pos] are similar, while mb_substr() is not. ";
