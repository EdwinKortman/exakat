description = "Yoda comparison is a way to write conditions which places literal values on the left side. 

if (1 == $a) {} 

The objective is to avoid mistaking a comparison to an assignation. If the comparison operateur is mistaken, but the literal is on the left, then an error will be triggered, instead of a silent bug. 

// error in comparison! 
if ($a = 1) {}
