name = "Suspicious Comparison";
description = "The comparison seems to be misplaced.

A comparison happens in the the last argument, while the actual function expect another type : this may be the case of a badly placed parenthesis.

<?php

// trim expect a string, a boolean is given.
if (trim($str === '')){

}

// Just move the first closing parenthesis to give back its actual meaning
if (trim($str === '')){

}

?>

Original idea by Vladimir Reznichenko.
