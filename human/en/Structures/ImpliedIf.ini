name = "No Implied If";
description = "It is possible to emulate a 'if...then' structure by using the operators 'and' and 'or'. Since optimizations will be applied to them : 
when the left operand of 'and' is false, the right one is not executed, as its result is useless; 
when the left operand of 'or' is true, the right one is not executed, as its result is useless; 

However, such structures are confusing. It is easy to misread them as conditions, and ignore an important logic step. 

It is recommended to use a real 'if then' structures, to make the condition readable.
