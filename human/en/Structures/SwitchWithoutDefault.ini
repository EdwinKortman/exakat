description = "Switch statements hold a number of \'case\' that cover all known situations, and a \'default\' one which is executed when all other options are exhausted. 

Most of the time, Switch do need a default case, so as to catch the odd situation where the \'value is not what it was expected\'. This is a good place to catch unexpected values, to set a default behavior.
