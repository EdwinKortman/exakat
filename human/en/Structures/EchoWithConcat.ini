description = "Optimize your echo's by not concatenating at echo time, but serving all argument separated. This will save PHP a memory copy.
If values (literals and variables) are small enough, this won't have impact. Otherwise, this is less work and less memory waste.

echo $a, ' b ', $c;

instead of

echo  $a . ' b ' . $c;
echo $a b $c;
