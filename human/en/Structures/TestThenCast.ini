name = "Test Then Cast";
description = "A test is run on the value, but the cast value is later used. 

The cast may introduce a distortion to the value, and still lead to the unwanted situation. For example, comparing to 0, then later casting to an int. The comparison to 0 is done without casting, and as such, 0.1 is different from 0. Yet, (int) 0.1 is actually 0, leading to a Division by 0 error.

<?php

// Here. $x may be different from 0, but (int) $x may be 0
$x = 0.1;

if ($x != 0) {
    $y = 4 / (int) $x;
}

// Safe solution : check the cast value.
if ( (int) $x != 0) {
    $y = 4 / (int) $x;
}

?>
