name = "Next Month Trap";
description = "Avoid using +1 month with strtotime(). 

strtotime() calculates the next month by incrementing the month number. For day number that do not exist from one month to the next, strtotime() fixes them by setting them in the next-next month. 

This happens to January, March, May, July, August and October. January is also vulnerable for 29 (not every year), 30 and 31. 

Avoid using '+1 month', and rely on 'first day of next month' or 'last day of next month' to extract the next month's name.

<?php

// Base date is October 31 => 10/31
// +1 month adds +1 to 10 => 11/31 
// Since November 31rst doesn't exists, it is corrected to 12/01. 
echo date('F', strtotime('+1 month',mktime(0,0,0,$i,31,2017))).PHP_EOL;

// Base date is October 31 => 10/31
echo date('F', strtotime('first day of next month',mktime(0,0,0,$i,31,2017))).PHP_EOL;

?>
