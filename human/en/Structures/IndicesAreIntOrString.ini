name = "Indices Are Int Or String";
description = "Indices in an array notation such as \$array['indice'] should be integers or string. Boolean, null or float will be converted to their integer or string equivalent.

Even integers inside strings will be converted, though not all of them : $array['8'] and $array[8] are the same, though $array['08'] is not. 

As a general rule of thumb, only use integers or strings that don\'t look like integers.
