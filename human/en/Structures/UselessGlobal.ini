description = "The listed global below are useless : they are only used once.

Also, PHP has superglobals, a special team of variables that are always available, whatever the context. 
They are : $GLOBALS, $_SERVER, $_GET, $_POST, $_FILES, $_COOKIE, $_SESSION, $_REQUEST and $_ENV. 
Simply avoid using 'global $_POST'. ";
