name = "Timestamp Difference";
description = "time() and microtime() shouldn't be used to calculate duration. 

time() and microtime are subject to variations, depending on system clock variations, such as daylight saving time difference (every spring and fall, one hour variation), or leap seconds, happening on June, 30th or december 31th, as announcec by IERS.

When the difference may be rounded to a larger time unit (rounding the difference to days, or several hours), the variation may be ignored safely.

If the difference may be very small, it requires a better way to mesure time difference, such as ticks, ext/hrtime, or including a check on the actual time zone (ini_get() with 'date.timezone').
