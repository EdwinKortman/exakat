name = "Nested ternary";
description = "Ternary operators ($a == 1 ? $b : $c) are a convenient instruction to apply some condition, and avoid a if() structure when it is simple (like in a one liner). 

However, ternary operators tends to make the syntax very difficult to read when they are nested. It is then recommended to use an if() structure, and make the whole code readable.";
