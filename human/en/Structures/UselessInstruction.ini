description = "The instructions below are useless. For example, running '<php 1 + 1; ?>' will do nothing, as the addition is actually performed, but not used : not displayed, not stored, not set. Just plain lost. 

The first level of the spotted instructions may be removed safely. For example, the analyzer will spot : '1 + $a++'; as a useless instruction. The addition is useless, but the plusplus is not. ";
