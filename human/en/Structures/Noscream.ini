name = "@ operator";
description = "@ is the 'no scream' operator : it will suppress error output. 

This operator is actually very slow : it will process the error all the way up, and finally decide not to display it. It is often faster to check the conditions first, then run the method without @.

You may also set display_error to 0 in the php.ini : this will avoid user's error display, but will keep the error in the PHP logs, for later processing. 

The only situation where @ is useful is when a native PHP function displays errors messages when error happens and there is no way to check it from the code. 
This is the case with fopen(). ";
clearphp = "";
