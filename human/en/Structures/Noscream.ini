name = "@ operator";
description = "@ is the 'no scream' operator : it will suppress error output. 

This operator is actually very slow : it is often better to check for the error before with a condition, and act upon, rather than ignore it.

The only situation where @ is useful is when an native PHP function is displaying errors messages, and there is no way to fix them from the PHP code. fopen() used to do so, but it doesn't do anymore. ";
