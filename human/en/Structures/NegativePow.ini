name = "Negative Power";
description = "The power operator has higher priority than the sign operator. This means that -2 ** 2 == -4. It is in fact, -(2 ** 2). 

When using negative power, it is clearer to add parenthesis or to use the pow() function, which has no such ambiguity : pow(-2, 2) == 4.";
