name = "Foreach With list()";
description = "PHP 5.5 introduced the ability to use list in foreach loops. This was not possible in the earlier versions.

<?php
    foreach($array as list($a, $b)) { 
        // do something 
    }
?>

Previously, it was compulsory to extract the data from the blind array : 

<?php
    foreach($array as $c) { 
        list($a, $b) = $c;
        // do something 
    }
?>
