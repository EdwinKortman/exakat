name = "Foreach with list()";
description = "PHP 5.5 introduced the ability to use list in foreach loops. This was not possible in the earlier versions.

foreach($array as list($a, $b)) { 
    // do something 
}

Previously, it was compulsory to extract the data from the blind array : 

foreach($array as $c) { 
    list($a, $b) = $c;
    // do something 
}

";
