name = "Nested Use";
description = "It is not recommended to build use with previous use statemts.

In PHP, it is possible to use previously declared Use expresssions to build another use statement. PHP use the already defined use to alter the prefixes.

This syntax is error prone. It is recommended to make the use statement clear, by relying on grouped declarations.

<?php

use A\B as C;     // C == A\B 
use C\D\E as F;   // F == A\B\D\E
use F\G as I;     // I == A\B\D\E\G;

// Same a above, less confusing
use A\{B, D\E, D\E\F\G}

use Z\Z\Y as A;   // A == Z\Z\Y; 
// This has no impact on previously defined use

?>
