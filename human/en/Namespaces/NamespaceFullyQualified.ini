name = "Namespace With Fully Qualified Name";
description = "The 'namespace' keyword has actually 2 usages : one is for declaring namespace, such as namespace A\\B\\C, use as first instruction in the script.

It may also mean 'current namespace' : for example, namespace\\A\\B\\C represents the constant C, in the sub-namespace A\\B of the current namespace (which is whatever you want).

The PHP compiler makes no difference between 'namespace \\A\\B\\C', and 'namespace\\A\\B\\C'. In each case, it will try to locate the constant C in the namespace \\A\\B, and will generate a fatal error if it can't find it.
