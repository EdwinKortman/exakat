name = "Avoid Non Wordpress Globals";
description = "Refren using any global variable that is not Wordpress's own. 

Global variables are available for write and read across the whole application, making their data both easily accessible, and difficult to track when a unexpected change happen. 
It is recommended to rely on a mix of arguments passing and classes structures to reduce the code of any variable to a smaller part of the code.

<?php

my_hook() {
    // This is a Wordpress global
    $GLOBALS['is_safari'] = true;
    
    // is_iphone7 is not a Wordpress variable
    global $is_iphone7;
}

?>
