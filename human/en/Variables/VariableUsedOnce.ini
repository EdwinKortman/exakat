name = "Variables used once";
description = "This is a list of variables, found in the application, and used only once.

Variables used once are usually useless : variables must be used at least twice. 

Some variables may be used once : 
+ PHP predefined variables, as they don't require any initialization. They are omitted in this analyze.
+ Dynamically created variables ($$x, or extract), as they are runtime values and can't be determined at static code time. 

The current analyzer count variables at the application level, and not at a method scope level. ";
