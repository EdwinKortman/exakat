name = "No array_merge In Loops";
description = "The function array_merge() is memory intensive : every call will duplicate the arguments in memory, before merging them. 

Since arrays way be quite big, it is recommended to avoid using merge in a loop. Instead, one should use array_merge with as many arguments as possible, making the merge a on time call.

This may be achieved easily with call_user_func_array('array_merge', array()) or the ... operator ";
