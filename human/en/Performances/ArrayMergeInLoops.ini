name = "No array_merge() In Loops";
description = "The function array_merge() is memory intensive : every call will duplicate the arguments in memory, before merging them. 

Since arrays may be quite big, it is recommended to avoid using array_merge() in a loop. Instead, one should use array_merge() with as many arguments as possible, making the merge a on time call.

This may be achieved easily with the variadic operator : array_merge(...array_collecting_the_arrays), or 
with call_user_func_array('array_merge', array_collecting_the_arrays()). The Variadic is slightly faster than call_user_func_array.

Note that array_merge_recursive() is also affected.
