description = "array_push() is slower than the [] operator.

This is also true if the [] operator is called several times, while array_push() may be called only once. 
And counting elements by the end of the push is still faster than collecting array_push() return value. 

<?php

$a = [1,2,3];
// Fast version
$a[] = 4;

$a[] = 5;
$a[] = 6;
$a[] = 7;
$count = count($a);

// Slow version
array_push($a, 4);
$count = array_push($a, 5,6,7);

?>

This is a micro-optimisation.
