name = "Performances/NoGlob";
description = "glob() and scandir() sorts results by default. If you don't need that sorting, save some time by requesting NOSORT with those functions.

Besides, whenever possible, use scandir() instead of glob(). 

<?php

// Scandir without sorting is the fastest. 
scandir('docs/', SCANDIR_SORT_NONE);

// Scandir sorts files by default. Same as above, but with sorting
scandir('docs/');

// glob sorts files by default. Same as below, but no sorting
glob('docs/*', GLOB_NOSORT);

// glob sorts files by default. This is the slowest version
glob('docs/*');

?>

Using opendir() and a while loop may be even faster. 

This analysis skips scandir() and glob() if they are explicitely configured with flags (aka, sorting is explicitely needed).

Glob() accepts wildchar, that may not easily replaced with scandir() or opendir().
