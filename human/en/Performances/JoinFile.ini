description = "Applying join() or implode() to the result of file() provides the same results than using file_get_contents(), but at a higher cost of memory and processing.

<?php

// memory and CPU intensive
$content = join('', file('path/to/file.txt'));

// memory intensive
$content = file_get_contents('path/to/file.txt');

// Consider reading the data line by line and processing it along the way, 
// to save memory 
$fp = fopen('path/to/file.txt', 'r');
while($line = fget($fp)) {
    // process a line
}
fclose($fp);

?>

Always use file_get_contents() to get the content of a file as a string. ";
