name = "Avoid Concat In Loop";
description = "Concatenations inside a loop generate a lot of temporary variables. They are accumulated and tend to raise the memory usage, leading to slower performances.

It is recommended to store the values in an array, and then use implode() on that array to make the concatenation at once.

<?php

// Concatenation in one operation
$tmp = array();
foreach(data_source() as $data) {
    $tmp[] = $data;
}
$final = implode('', $tmp);

// Concatenation in many operations
foreach(data_source() as $data) {
    $final .= $data;
}

?>

The same doesn't apply to += or *=, with array_sum() and array_multiply(), as addition and multiplication works on the current memory allocation, and don't need to allocate new memory at each step.
