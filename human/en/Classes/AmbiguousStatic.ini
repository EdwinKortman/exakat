name = "Ambiguous Static";
description = "Methods or properties are sometimes defined static, and sometimes not. This is error prone, as it require a better knowledge of the code to make it static or not. 

Try to keep the static-ness of methods simple, and unique. Consider renaming the methods to distinguish them easily. A method and a static method have probably different responsabilities.

<?php

class a {
    function mixedStaticMethod() {}
}

class b {
    static function mixedStaticMethod() {}
}

/... a lot more code later .../

$c->mixedStaticMethod();
// or 
$c::mixedStaticMethod();

?>
