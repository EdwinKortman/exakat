name = "Redefined Private Property";
description = "Private properties are local to their defined class. PHP doesn't forbid the re-declaration of a private property in a child class.

However, having two or more properties with the same name, in the class hierarchy tends to be error prone. 

<?php

class A {
    private $isReady = true;
}

class B {
    private $isReady = false;
}
