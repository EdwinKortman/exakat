name = "Multiple Class Declarations";
description = "It is possible to declare several times the same class in the code. PHP will not notice it until execution time, since declarations may be conditional. 

It is recommended to avoid declaring several times the same class in the code. At least, separate them with namespaces, they are for here for that purpose.";
