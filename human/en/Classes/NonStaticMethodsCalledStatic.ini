name = "Non static methods called in a static";
description = "Static methods have to be declared as such (using the static keyword). Then, 
one may call them without instantiating the object.

However, PHP doesn't check that a method is static or not : at any point, you may call one
method statically : 

class x {
    static public function sm() { echo __METHOD__.\\n; }
    public sm() { echo __METHOD__.\\n; }
} 

x::sm(); // echo x::sm 

It is a bad idea to call non-static method statically. Such method may make use of special
variable $this, which will be undefined. PHP will not check those calls at compile time,
nor at running time. 

It is recommended to fix this situation : make the method actually static, or use it only 
in object context.
