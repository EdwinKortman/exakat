description = "A long time ago, PHP classes used to have the method bearing the same name as the class acts as the constructor.

This is no more the case in PHP 5, which relies on __construct() to do so. Having this old style constructor may bring in confusion, unless you are also supporting old time PHP 4.

Note that classes with methods bearing the class name, but inside a namespace are not following this convention, as this is not breaking backward compatibility. Those are excluded from the analyze.
