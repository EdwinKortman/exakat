description = "The following classes used to have a very specific behavior during instantiation : they were able to return NULL on new.

After issuing a 'new' with those classes, it was important to check if the returned object were null (sic) or not. No exception were thrown.

This inconsistency has been cleaned in PHP 7 : see https://wiki.php.net/rfc/internal_constructor_behaviour.
