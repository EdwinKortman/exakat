However, they are never used to enforce objects in the code, using instanceof or a typehint. 
As they are currently used, those interfaces may be removed without change in behavior.

// only defined interface but never enforced
interface i {};
class c implements i {} 

interfaces should be used in Typehint or with the instanceof operator.
