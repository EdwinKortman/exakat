name = "Slice Arrays First";
description = "Always start by reducing an array before applying some transformation on it. The shorter array will be processed faster. 

<?php

// fast version
$a = array_map('foo', array_slice($array, 2, 5));

// slower version
$a = array_slice(array_map('foo', $array), 2, 5);
?>

The gain produced here is greater with longer arrays, or greater reductions. They may also be used in loops. This is a micro-optimisation when used on short arrays and single array slicings.
