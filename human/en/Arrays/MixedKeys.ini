name = "Mixed Keys";
description = "When defining default values in arrays, it is recommended to avoid mixing constants and literals, as PHP may mistake them and overwrite the previous with the latter.

Either switch to a newer version of PHP (5.5 or newer), or make sure the resulting array is the one you expect. If not, reorder the definitions.

<?php

const ONE = 1;

$a = [ 1   => 2,
       ONE => 3];

?>
