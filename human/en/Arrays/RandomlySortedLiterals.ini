name = "Randomly Sorted Arrays";
description = "Those literals arrays are written in several places, but in various orders. 

This may reduce the reading and proofing of the arrays, and induce confusion.

Unless order is important, it is recommended to always use the same order when defining literal arrays.

<?php

// an array
$set = [1,3,5,9,10];

function foo() {
    // an array, with the same values but different order, in a different context
    $list = [1,3,5,10,9,];
}

// an array, with the same order than the initial one
$inits = [1,3,5,9,10];

?>
