name = "Multiple Exceptions Catch()";
description = "Starting with PHP 7.1, it is possible to have several distinct exceptions class caught by the same catch, preventing code repetition. 

<?php

// PHP 7.1 and more recent
try {  
    throw new someException(); 
} catch (Single $s) {
    doSomething();
} catch (oneType | anotherType $s) {
    processIdentically();
} finally {

}

// PHP 7.0 and older
try {  
    throw new someException(); 
} catch (Single $s) {
    doSomething();
} catch (oneType $s) {
    processIdentically();
} catch (anotherType $s) {
    processIdentically();
} finally {

}

This is a backward incompabitible feature of PHP 7.1.
