name = "Compare Hash";
description = "When comparing hash values, it is important to use the strict comparison : === or !==. 

In a number of situations, the hash value will start with '0e', and PHP will understand that the comparison involves integers : it will then convert the strings into numbers, and it may end up converting them to 0.

Here is an example 

<?php

// The two following passwords hashes matches, while they are not the same. 
$hashed_password = 0e462097431906509000000000000;
if (hash('md5','240610708',false) == $hashed_password) {
  print Matched.\n;
}
?>

You may also use password_hash() and password_verify().
