name = "Unserialize Second Arg";
description = "Since PHP 7, unserialize() function has a second argument that limits the classes that may be unserialized. In case of a breach, this is limiting the classes accessible from unserialize(). 

On way to exploit unserialize, is to make PHP unserialized the data to an available class, may be one that may be auto-loaded.

<?php

// expected Database object
$var = unserialize('O:7:"dbClass":0:{}');

// unexpected load of debugClass object
$var = unserialize('O:10:"debugClass":0:{}');

// Using the unserialized object
$var->connect();

?>
