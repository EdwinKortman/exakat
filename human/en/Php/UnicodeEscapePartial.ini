name = "Unicode Escape Partial";
description = "PHP 7 introduces a new escape sequence for strings : \u{hex}. It is backward incompatible with previous PHP versions for two reasons : 

PHP 7 will recognize en replace those sequences, while PHP 5 keep them intact.
PHP 7 will chocke on partial Unicode Sequences, as it tries to understand them, but may fail. 

Is is recommended to check all those strings, and make sure they will behave correctly in PHP 7. ";
