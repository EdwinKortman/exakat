description = "rand() provides random number. A better and more varied version is mt_rand(), which is a drop-in replacement. 

Since PHP 7, random_int() (and its cousin random_byte()), provides cryptographically secure pseudo-random bytes, which are good to be used
when security is involved. openssl_random_pseudo_bytes() may be used when the OpenSSL extension is available.";
