// Avoid using this
$random = rand(0, 10);

// Drop-in replacement
$random = mt_rand(0, 10);

Since PHP 7, random_int() (and its cousin random_bytes()), provides cryptographically secure pseudo-random bytes, which are good to be used
when security is involved. openssl_random_pseudo_bytes() may be used when the OpenSSL extension is available.";
