name = "PHP 7.1 Microseconds";
description = "PHP 7.1 supports microseconds in DateTime class and date_create() function. 

In previous PHP versions, those dates only used seconds, leading to lazy comparisons : 

<?php

$now = date_create();
usleep(10);              // wait for 0.001 ms
var_dump($now == date_create());

?>

This code displays true in PHP 7.0 and older, (unless the code was run too close from the next second). In PHP 7.1, this is always false.

This is also true with Datetime : 

<?php

$now = new DateTime();
usleep(10);              // wait for 0.001 ms
var_dump((new DateTime())->format('u') == $now->format('u'));

?>

This evolution impacts mostly exact comparisons (== and ===). Non-equality (!= and !==) will probably be always true, and should be reviewed.
