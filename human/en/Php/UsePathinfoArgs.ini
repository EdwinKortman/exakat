name = "Use pathinfo() Arguments";
description = "pathinfo() has a second argument to select only useful data. 

It is twice faster to get only one element from pathinfo() than get the four of them, and use only one.

This analysis reports pathinfo() usage, without second argument, where only one or two indices are used, afte the call.

<?php

// This could use only PATHINFO_BASENAME
function foo_db() {
    $a = pathinfo($file2);
    return $a['basename'];
}

// This could be 2 calls, with PATHINFO_BASENAME and PATHINFO_DIRNAME.
function foo_de() {
    $a = pathinfo($file3);
    return $a['dirname'].'/'.$a['basename'];
}

// This is OK : 3 calls to pathinfo() is slower than array access.
function foo_deb() {
    $a = pathinfo($file4);
    return  $a['dirname'].'/'.$a['filename'].'.'.$a['extension'];
}

?>

Depending on the situation, the functions dirname() and basename() may also be used. They are even faster, when only fetching those data.
