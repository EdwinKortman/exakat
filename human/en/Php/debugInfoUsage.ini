name = "__debugInfo() usage";
description = "The magic function __debugInfo() has been introduced in PHP 5.6. In the previous versions of PHP, this method is ignored and won't be called when debugging.

<?php

// PHP 5.6 or later
class foo {
    private $bar = 1;
    private $reallyHidden = 2;
    
    function __debugInfo() {
        return ['bar' => $this->bar,
                'reallyHidden' => 'Secret'];
    }
}

$f = new Foo();
var_dump($f);

?>

This ends up with : 

<?literal 
object(foo)#1 (2) {
  [bar]=>
  int(1)
  [reallyHidden]=>
  string(6) Secret
}

?>
