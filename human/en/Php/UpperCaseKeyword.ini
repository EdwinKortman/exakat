description = "Usual convention is to write PHP keywords (like as, foreach, switch, case, break, etc.) all in lowercase.

// usual PHP convention
foreach($array as $element) {
    echo $element;

// unusual PHP conventions
Foreach($array AS $element) {

PHP do understand them in lowercase, UPPERCASE or WilDCase, so there is nothing compulsory here. Although, it will look strange to many. ";
