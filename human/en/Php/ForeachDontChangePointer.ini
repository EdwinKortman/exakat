name = "Foreach Don't Change Pointer";
description = "In PHP 7.0, the foreach loop won't change the internal pointer of the array, but will work on a copy. So, applying array pointer's functions such as current() or next() to the source array won't have the same behavior than in PHP 5.

This anly applies when a foreach() by reference is used.

<?php

$numbers = range(1, 10);
next($numbers);
foreach($numbers as &$number){
    print $number;
    print current($numbers)."\n"; // Always 
}

?>
