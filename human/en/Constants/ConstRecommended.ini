name = "Use const";
description = "The const keyword may be used to define constant, just like the define() function. 

When defining a constant, it is recommended to use 'const' when the features of the constant are not dynamical (name or value are known at compile time). 
This way, constant will be defined at compile time, and not at execution time. 

define() function is useful for all other situations.
