name = "Wrong Optional parameter";
description = "PHP parameters are optional when they defined with a default value, like this : function x($arg = 1) {...}.

When there are compulsory and optional parameters, the first ones should appear first, and the second should appear last : function x($arg, $arg2 = 2) {...}.

PHP will solve this problem at runtime, assign values in the same other, but will miss some of the default values and emits warnings. 

It is better to put all the optional parameters at the end of the method\'s signature.
