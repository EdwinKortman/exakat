description = "Those arguments may use the callable Typehint. 

'callable' is a PHP keyword that represents callback functions. Those may be used in dynamic function call, like $function(); or as callback functions, like with array_map();

callable may be a string representing a function name or a static call (including ::), an array with two elements, (a class or object, and a method), or a closure.

When arguments are used to call a function, but are not marked with 'callable', they are reported by this analysis.

<?php

function foo(callable $callable) {
    // very simple callback
    return $callable();
}

function foo2($array, $callable) {
    // very simple callback
    return array_map($array, $callable);
}

?>
